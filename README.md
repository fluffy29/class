Tracks a count: The class maintains an internal integer variable value to store the current count


Starts at zero: When a new Counter object is created using counter = Counter(), the value is automatically initialized to 0


Increments by one: The increment method adds 1 to the value attribute. This allows you to increase the count



Decrements by one (conditionally): The decrement method checks if the current value is greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts 1 
from value. This ensures the count doesn't go negative



No limit on the count: This basic implementation doesn't have a predefined maximum or minimum value for the count. The value can grow or shrink as long as it remains an integer
